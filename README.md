# Pythonic-Monopoly

This program utilizes Python visualizations to create an interactive dashboard exploring the San Francisco real estate market.


All code within the Rental Analysis workspace and Dashboard workspace run successfully.  Unfortunately, my Dashboard does not display the way that it should.  Please see "Pics" folder to see how Dashboard appears on my computer, as well as the plots that the Dashboard would have shown should the Dashboard have appeared correctly.
